As explained on the report, Version 2 has been trained on the files 0, 1, 2, 4 hevc and txt provided in the directory labeled. 

In the directory "video_3" you will find two files :
	3.txt which is the initial file for this video.
	3_predict.txt which is the file I generated using my model for the prediction.

The scipt eval_fic allows you to compare these two files and will give an error score.
(Just run the script with this command "python eval_fic")

The "outputs" directory contains the prediction of the unlabeled videos.
